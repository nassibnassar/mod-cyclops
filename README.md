## Overview

This is a [FOLIO](https://folio.org/) module providing access to CCD, the server of [the CCMS software](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/indexdata/ccms) that powers [CYCLOPS](https://www.indexdata.com/cyclops/). It exists so that we can create a FOLIO-based UI for CYCLOPS. It presents a somewhat RESTful WSAPI, in contrast with the command-based API of the underlying software, largely so that FOLIO permissions can be applied to the various endpoints.


## Building

Run `make` in the top-level directory to generate the binary, `mod-cyclops`, and the various descriptors required to run it as a FOLIO module under Okapi. Both the binary and the generated descriptors are placed in the `target` directory. `make lint` will run a selection of code-quality tools over the source code, and `make clean` will remove all generated fields. There are presently no unit tests.


## Invocation

`mod-cyclops` takes no command-line arguments and has no configuration file. It is configured entirely by environment variables:

* Configuring the service provided:
  * `SERVER_HOST`, `SERVER_PORT` -- the host and port on which `mod-cyclops` listens. Host defaults to `0.0.0.0`, which listens on all interfaces; port defaults to 12370.
  * `MOD_CYCLOPS_QUERY_TIMEOUT` -- The number of seconds that the server will hold open a client connection before timing out a long-running request. Defaults to 60 seconds.
* Configuring the CCMS service used:
  * `CCMS_HOST` -- The hostname of a CCMS service to connect to. Must be defined.
  * `CCMS_PORT` -- The port number to connect to on that host. Defaults to 8504.
  * `CCMS_USER`, `CCMS_PASSWORD` -- The name of the user to authenticate as on the CCMS service and the corresponding password.
* Configuring logging (see [`catlogger`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MikeTaylor/catlogger) for overview):
  * `LOGGING_CATEGORIES` or `LOGCAT` -- A comma-separated list of categories in which messages will be logged: see below for available categories.
  * `LOGGING_PREFIX` -- If specified, a string that will be included at the start of each logging line. Can be helpful for disambiguating logging output from other kinds of output.
  * `LOGGING_TIMESTAMP` -- If specified, then each line of logging contains a timestamp.
* Configuring dummy data:
  * `MOD_CYCLOPS_DUMMY_DATA` -- If specified, then the CCMS server is never contacted, but dummy responses are provided to each WSAPI call. This facility is provided to enable UI development to begin before CCMS is functional, and **may be removed in future**.

Logging messages are emitted under the following categories, if those categories are included in the comma-separated list in the `LOGGING_CATEGORIES` or `LOGCAT` environment variable:

* `listen` -- Log when the server has been started up and begun to listen, noting the listening host and port.
* `path` -- Log each incoming request with its method (GET, POST, etc.) and path.
* `command` -- Log each complex generated CCMS command, e.g. Retrieve commands.
* `error` -- Log errors that are returned to the client.

So, for example, if the server is run as `env LOGCAT=listen,error target/mod-cyclops`, then a message will be emitted at startup, when the server has begun to listen, but it will otherwise remain quiet apart from logging any errors that might occur.

## Development

In order to use this module as part of a FOLIO system, the simplest approach is to run a FOLIO virtual machine and tunnel its Okapi port 9130 out to the host operating system. Once this has been done, the running mod-cyclops can be made available by posting the module descriptor to Okapi, then posting a deployment descriptor that points at the running process, and finally enabling the module for the `diku` tenant.
```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @target/ModuleDescriptor.json http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"srvcId": "mod-cyclops-0.0.1", "instId": "127.0.0.1-12370-v2", "url" : "http://127.0.0.1:12370"}' http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"id": "mod-cyclops-0.0.1"}' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/diku/modules
```

### Private note to self

When SSHing from the development laptop `winston` to the desktop machine `widow` that hosts the FOLIO VM, use:
```
winston$ ssh -L 9130:localhost:9130 -L 3001:localhost:3000 -R 12370:localhost:12370 widow
widow$ cd ~/metadb/folio-release; vagrant ssh
vagrant$ ssh -L 12370:localhost:12370 mike@widow
```
And in another `vagrant ssh` window, `curl http://127.0.0.1:12370/admin/health` to check the double tunnel is working.

In the first `ssh` invocation above, we are making widow's Okapi (port 9130) available on winston, and as a gratuitous bonus its Stripes bundle too (mapped from port 3000 to 3001 to avoid colliding with any locally running Stripes bundle). We are also making our local mod-cyclops (port 12370) available on widow.

In the second `ssh` invocation, which happens inside the FOLIO VM running on widow, we make widow's mod-cyclops (port 12370, forwarded from winston) available within the VM, so Okapi can invoke it.
